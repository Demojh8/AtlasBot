# An Open Source Robot Arm with Graphical User Interface.
The Ultimate Goal of AtlasBot is to Become a Mobile Manipulation Platform with SLAM and ML Capability for research and education purposes.
I hope this project can make robotics more approachable to everyone. Please feel free to contact me if you have questions or would like to contribute to it.
You'll need Arduino Mega 2560 to use the code directly to control a robot arm. 
To run the GUI, pythonOCC needs to be installed.
